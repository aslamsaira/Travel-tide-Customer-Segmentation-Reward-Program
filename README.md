# Travel-tide-Customer-Segmentation-Reward-Program

E-booking startup TravelTide is a hot new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Customer feedback has shown - and industry analysts agree - that TravelTide customers have access to the largest travel inventory in the e-booking space. Elena Tarrant, the new Head of Marketing. 

Elena has been brought on to supercharge the Marketing efforts at TravelTide. She is well known in the Marketing community as an expert in customer retention strategies, specifically rewards programs, an advanced feature proven to generate repeat business if executed well. Elena’s mission is to design and execute a fantastic personalized rewards program that keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform. It is difficult to personalize rewards for customers without first understanding them, so for the project to be successful, Elena will need to lean on the data team for customer insights. 

Thanks for your help on this @Analyst! Here are some important things to keep in mind as well as next steps. 

This initial stage of the project has two aspects: 

Decide on perks to offer in our rewards program From my past experience, the perks most like to attract customers are:

•⁠ ⁠free hotel meal 

•⁠ ⁠free checked bag 

•⁠ ⁠no cancellation fees 

•⁠ ⁠exclusive discounts 

•⁠ ⁠1 night free hotel with flight 

•⁠ ⁠Get our customers to sign up for the rewards program! Also from my experience, perks don't have equal importance to customers, everyone has a favorite perk. When we email customers inviting them to sign up for the program, we will need to personalize the message by highlighting what we think the customer cares about most. If we don't get this right, customers will not click on the email! I need your help to validate the perks above will attract customers and assign customers to segments according to what we think their favorite perk is. Elena believes that to grab customers’ attention and maximize the likelihood they will sign up for the rewards program, we want to emphasize the perk we think they are most interested in when we ask them to sign up. 

Our mission as Data Analysts is two-fold. First, we need to check if the data supports Elena’s hypothesis about the existence of customers that would be especially interested in the perks she is proposing, then, for each customer, assign a likely favorite perk.
